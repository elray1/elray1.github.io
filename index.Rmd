## About

I am a research assistant professor of biostatistics in the [Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology](https://www.umass.edu/public-health-sciences/academics/departments/biostatistics-and-epidemiology) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Along with [Dr. Nick Reich](http://reichlab.io/), I co-direct the [US COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/). In various research projects, I have developed methods to classify physical activity using accelerometer data and developed semi-parametric and ensemble models for predicting the timing and severity of the spread of infectious disease.
